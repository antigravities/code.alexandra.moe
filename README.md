"It will feature a procedurally crafted world also containing hand-crafted parts, a lot of NPC living their own lives and running an economy, plenty of customizable weapons to make the destructible terrain go boom. It will be roguelike-ish, and I hope I’ll make it work both in turn-based and real-time modes. The game will take place in a more hostile environment than GRA. 2D and top-down viewpoint, and moddable, as usual."
